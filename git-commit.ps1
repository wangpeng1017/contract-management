Core improvements deployed:
- Enhanced error handling in contract generation API with detailed error messages

- src/app/api/test/database/route.ts - new database connection test endpoint
- src/lib/template-storage.ts - improved traditional content generation
- Enhanced error messages for better production debugging

Deployment verification:
- Database test API should be accessible at /api/test/database
- Contract generation API should return detailed error messages
- All previous TypeScript and build issues resolved
- Ready for production testing and validation
